    <!--  1) Create a web app which has input in which user will enter his password. Due to privacy, can you hide the text which user is typing? (in password form) and what if user wants to check his written password? can u show user? Also, password must be above 10 characters, so keep bg color as red until password is greater than 10 and then make the bg color green. Your time starts now! Bonus: You have to toggle hide and show password!-->

    <input onkeyup=""class= "input-password" type="password">
    <label class="toggle" for=""> Show</label>
